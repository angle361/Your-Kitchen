## Motivation

We all know that India is worldwide famous for the variety of dishes and meals here. Not only that, each and every state in itself has something special depicting its own culture. The Covid-19 pandemic and the following lockdown have introduced us to many new facets of life. Confined to their homes for nearly two years, people found new ways to express their creativity. Ever since the beginning of the unforeseen pandemic, most of the people in quarantine explored dishes, cooking and related stuff.

What if we could have one platform to get all the recipes? This was the main motivation behind my project under the lifestyle category.

This Web Application provides information about a wide range of recipes including different categories. Users could learn making different delicious dishes with the help of given cooking instructions and ingredients information. A user-friendly Chat Bot(Chef) developed using Azure Bot Services and QnA Maker Services is also incorporated on the platform to address the doubts and questions of the users.

## Tools And Technologies Used
The web application is developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Google fonts, Font Awesome, Azure Bot Services, QnA Maker and Static Web Apps
